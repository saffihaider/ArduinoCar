# ArduinoCar

I created a Bluetooth-controlled car, based on an Arduino Uno development board which features an L293D motor driver shield, 2 DC hobby motors, a servo, an HC-05 Bluetooth module, and a piezo buzzer as a horn. The car is controlled by an Android app.

I initially used regular DC motors, however, they didn't provide enough torque to drive the car. Thus, I switched to geared motors with a 1:48 gear ratio. Unfortunately, due to COVID, I did not have access to a 3D printer. Thus, the chassis was primarily made of cardboard.
